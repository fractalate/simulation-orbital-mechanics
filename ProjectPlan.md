# Project Plan

## Goal

I'd like to produce software capable of planning spacecraft trajectories in our solar system given practical, real-world constraints.

## Action Plan

* [ ] Create an accurate model of our solar system in the simulator that is capable of predicting planetary and moon positions up to 10 years into the future.
  - [ ] Elliptical orbits of the planets.
  - [ ] Moon of Earth.
  - [ ] Moons of Mars.
  - [ ] Moons of Jupiter.
  - [ ] Moons of Saturn.
  - [ ] Moons of Uranus.
  - [ ] Moons of Neptune.
  - [ ] Elliptical orbit of the Pluto system with moons.
* [ ] Create a spacecraft model including its mass and thrust capabilities which can traverse the simulated system, accounting for mass changes as thrut is applied in various ways.
  - [ ] Simulated launch configurations.
  - [ ] Omni-directional thrust system (theorhetical).
  - [ ] Flight planning to control thrust systems.
  - [ ] Practical thrust systems.
  - [ ] Re-entry detection.
* [ ] Brainstorm about a model for searching for trajectories given the intended destination and acceptable speed/orientations.
